Factory Design Pattern:
whenever we want to create objects of classes which are implementing the same
interface lets say shape and classes are rectangle,square, circle or any other
we create a factory which encapsulates classes code and give object os these classes
wherever it requires (it encapsulates, simplifies usuage and also extensible)
factory has-a relationship with Shape (as it returns it)

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern:
 It is used to provide an interface for creating families of related or
 ]dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 Let's apply this pattern to create two groups of car manufacturers:
 a luxury car group (Mercedes and Audi) and an economy car group
 (Maruti and Hyundai).
 Simply, it applies whenever we have grouping of objects
